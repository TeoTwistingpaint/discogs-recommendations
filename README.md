# Discogs' Recommendations

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The proposed AI solution aims to provide personalized suggestions for music lovers based on their purchases on the Discogs website. The solution will help users discover new music, connect with artists, and revive the nostalgia of vinyl records.


## Background

With the rise of digital music platforms, vinyl records may seem like a thing of the past. However, vinyl sales have been on the rise, indicating a resurgence in the popularity of analog music. Music lovers often turn to vinyl records for their superior sound quality and the nostalgic experience of playing a physical record. However, with the vast number of options available on Discogs, finding new music can be overwhelming. The proposed AI solution will use the user's purchase history to suggest similar artists and albums, making it easier for users to discover new music that fits their preferences.


## How is it used?

The proposed AI solution will analyze the user's purchase history on Discogs and suggest similar artists and albums that the user may be interested in. The user can then explore these suggestions and make new purchases. The solution will be available as a web application that users can access through their web browser. The application will use a simple and user-friendly interface that will enable users to interact with the AI model and receive personalized suggestions.

The users of the solution will be music lovers who purchase music on the Discogs website. The solution will cater to the needs of users who want to discover new music based on their preferences. The solution's primary goal is to provide a personalized music discovery experience that connects users with artists and helps them explore new music.

## Data sources and AI methods

The solution will use data from the Discogs website to generate personalized music suggestions. The solution will collect the user's purchase history, including the artist, album, and genre of music purchased. The AI model will use this data to generate a personalized recommendation list of artists and albums that the user may be interested in.

The AI model will use a content-based filtering approach to generate personalized music suggestions. The model will analyze the user's purchase history to identify patterns and similarities in the type of music purchased. The model will then use this information to generate recommendations that fit the user's preferences. The AI model will be built using Python and will use machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

## Challenges

One challenge in building the proposed AI solution is data privacy. The solution will need access to the user's purchase history to generate personalized recommendations. The solution will need to ensure that user data is kept private and secure. Additionally, the model's accuracy may be limited by the amount and quality of data available. The model's performance will depend on the quality and quantity of data collected from the user's purchase history.

## What next?

The proposed AI solution can be expanded to include additional features such as user ratings and reviews. User ratings and reviews can provide valuable information about the user's preferences and help improve the accuracy of the AI model. Additionally, the solution can be integrated with other music platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music to provide a more comprehensive music discovery experience.

To move forward, the project will require expertise in data engineering, machine learning, and web development. Additionally, the project will require access to the Discogs API and the user's purchase history data.


## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the rising popularity of vinyl records and the need for personalized music recommendations. The proposed AI solution builds on existing research in content-based filtering and data-driven recommendations. There are no affiliations with Discogs and it's just an idea expressed from personal taste and habits.
